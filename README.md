# MythicalPanel
MythicalPanel is currently a small project that aims to provide access to various QoL functions towards Minecraft servers that are being run in Docker.
Think of things like console access, plugin list, server status check & much more!

## Requirements
 - Python
 - pipenv
 - NodeJS
 - yarn

## How to install
To install the project, first clone it to your local machine.
To get all required packages installed, simply run ``pipenv install`` & ``yarn`` and wait for both to finish.
Once finished, rename ``.env.example`` to simply ``.env``.
All that's left now is to apply all migrations using Django and you're pretty much good to go
